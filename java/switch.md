Another way to write if statements is with the use of `switch`âœ¨. It's a more efficient way of using `else if` using only 1 set of curly braces and uses expressions instead of tests. Instead of the typical `else if` it uses cases inside 1 expression.

There format looks like this:
```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        //instructions for value1;
    break;
    case value2:
        //instructions for value2;
    break;
    case value3:
        //instructions for value3;
    break;
    default:
        //instructions for no matching case;
}
```
